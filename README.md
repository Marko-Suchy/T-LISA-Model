# T-LISA-Model Project Repository
Here, you will find python files for data generation and analysis, associated with the T-LISA model (both agent-based and mean-field.) Note that generated data files are not included in this repository, as they are too large to include. A full PDF of this honors thesis was catalogued at Washington and Lee's library in June 2024, but it not publically availible as it is currently being prepared for submission to a journal. However, you can find a PowerPoint presentation of my thesis, along with a poster presented at the American Physical Society 2024 March Meeting.


## Project Abstract:
We study innovation dynamics through social networks, including the possibility for rejection of innovation. We make a slight improvement to the LISA model mean-field, such that is results in a steady state with exclusively Adopter and Luddites. We then implement this improved model on Erdos-Renyi random graphs using Monte-Carlo techniques. We study the match between mean field and Monte-Carlo based approaches. We then use regression analysis to understand how both local and global network structural features effect the extent of innovation adoption in the final state. We find that under T-LISA dynamics, adoption is most likley to spread through small dense network clusters.

## Demonstrated Skills and Techniques
* Network based Monte-Carlo simulation in Python
* Database management
* Python NetworkX package proficiency
* Data visualization using matplotlib in Python
* Regression analysis using statsmodels in Python
* Data wrangling using Pandas in Python
* Technical writing

## Data Sources
All data for this project was generated in Monte-Carlo simulations.

## Final Product Description
The Final products of this project include a poster, a powerpoint, and a paper. The poster was presentat at the American Physical Society 2024 March Meeting. The powerpoint was publicly presented in April 2024, to the Washington and Lee community. The paper will soon be archved in the W&L library, upon it's completeion.
