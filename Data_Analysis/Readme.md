## Data Analysis
In this folder, you will find scripts which were used to analyze data generated by the LISA and T-LISA models. A breif description of each script follows:

- **Run_Regessions.py**: This script runs OLS regressions to predict total average error by the independent variables $N$, $k$, $r$, $\gamma$, and $\omega$.
- **Node_Level_Attribute_regression.py**: 
- **Make_Box_Plots.py**
- **Plot_Stochastic_T-LISA_Sims.py**:
- **Join_Structural_and_run_data.py**:
- ... There's probably others too?
